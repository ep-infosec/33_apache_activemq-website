How to Help
-----------

Everyone in the ActiveMQ community can help with releases; users, developers, commmiters are all encouraged to test out a release and post any comments to the [activemq-dev@ mailing list](contact#mailing) or create an [issue](issues).

ActiveMQ is available in both source and binary distributions. See [Getting Started](getting-started).
