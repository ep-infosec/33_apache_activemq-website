#### Summary

[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) was recently announced and it has caused quite a bit of traffic on the mailing lists and in Jira from users curious about its impact on both ActiveMQ "Classic" and Artemis. In short, **CVE-2021-44228 has no impact on any ActiveMQ broker** because no ActiveMQ broker uses any version of Log4j2. To reiterate, **no action is required to mitigate CVE-2021-44228**.

#### Additional Details

ActiveMQ "Classic" *does* use Log4j for logging, but the latest versions (i.e. [5.15.15](https://activemq.apache.org/activemq-5015015-release) and [5.16.3](https://activemq.apache.org/activemq-5016003-release)) use Log4j 1.2.17 which is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228. This version of Log4j has been used since 5.7.0. The upcoming ActiveMQ [5.17.0](https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/main) [will use Log4j2](https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/662), but the pull request will be updated to use a later version of Log4j 2.x before merging to mitigate this CVE.

ActiveMQ Artemis *does not* use Log4j for logging. However, Log4j 1.2.17 is included in the Hawtio-based web console application archive (i.e. `web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib`). Although this version of Log4j is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228 future versions of Artemis will be updated so that the Log4j jar is no longer included in the web console application archive. See [ARTEMIS-3612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-3612) for more information on that task.
