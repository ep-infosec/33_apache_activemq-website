New and Noteworthy
------------------

This is a major update for the ActiveMQ-CPP library adding in support for SSL, QueueBrowser, Message compression and more. Many issues have been addressed as well as work to improve performance and prevent memory leaks.

The SSL support makes use of the OpenSSL libraries so you need them installed to use it.

**NOTE:** Compatible with ActiveMQ Broker versions in the 4.X and 5.X family
