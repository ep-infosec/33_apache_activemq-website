New and Noteworthy
------------------

This is our first official release of ActiveMQ CPP. Some of the included features are:

*   CMS - a JMS-like API
*   Implementation of the Stomp protocol (compatable with AMQ broker 4.0.2 and later)
*   Extensible architecture for supporting additional messaging protocols (focus on OpenWire for the next major release)
*   Robust, Java-like library providing streams, readers/writers, and even a synchronized macro
*   Build has been tested on win32, linux, solaris, and OSX

**NOTE:** Compatable with ActiveMQ Broker version >= 4.0.2
