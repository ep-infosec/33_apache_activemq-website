[Fuse Message Broker](http://fusesource.com/products/enterprise-activemq/) is a certified distribution of Apache ActiveMQ provided by FuseSource. [FuseSource](http://fusesource.com) does all of its development and bug fixes as part of the Apache ActiveMQ community, so there are no functional differences between the two. FuseSource may do more frequent releases than Apache, so it is possible to get bug fixes from a Fuse Message Broker release sooner than from an official Apache ActiveMQ release.
