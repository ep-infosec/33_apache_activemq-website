Whether you have a simple question about configuration, a use-case you're confused about, a new feature you want to discuss, etc. the community is here to help.

If you're fairly certain you're hitting a bug [please report it](issues) via one of our issue trackers.

#### Mailing Lists

The **best** way to contact folks in the community is by using one of the mailing lists.
 - **Users**: for users configuring & managing an ActiveMQ broker as well as messaging application developers
 - **Dev**: for developers working _directly_ on one of the ActiveMQ code-bases

To subscribe to or unsubscribe from a list simply:
 1. Send a blank email to the appropriate address (see below).
 1. The automated mailing list manager will send an reply (either a confirmation request or an error message, e.g. if you are not subscribed).
 1. Reply to the confirmation message.

Mailing list participants are expected to abide by the well-established rules of "netiquette," as well as the ASF's published [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

**Please read these [tips for email contributors](https://apache.org/dev/contrib-email-tips.html)**, especially if you're not getting the support you expect. 

If you're curious you can [read more](https://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html) about how these lists work at Apache.


#### Chat

If for some reason a mailing list doesn't work for you then you can potentially chat with other community members in real-time using **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**. Access to the [ASF Slack](https://the-asf.slack.com) requires an invitation. If you want an invitation to the ActiveMQ Slack channel simply send a request to the [users mailing list](#mailing).
