CVE-2020-13920: Apache ActiveMQ JMX is vulnerable to a MITM attack

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Affected Version: Apache ActiveMQ version prior to 5.15.12

Vulnerability details:
Apache ActiveMQ uses LocateRegistry.createRegistry() to create the JMX RMI
registry and binds the server to the "jmxrmi" entry. It is possible
to connect to the registry without authentication and call the rebind
method to rebind jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker creates another
server to proxy the original, and bound that, he effectively becomes a 
man in the middle and is able to intercept the credentials when an user
connects.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12
