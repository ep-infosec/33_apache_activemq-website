PRODUCT AFFECTED:
This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Apache ActiveMQ, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

In this case, for Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to version 2.16.0 and Apache ActiveMQ prior to versions 5.16.1 and 5.15.14, the anonymous context is used to verify a valid users password in error, resulting in no check on the password.
