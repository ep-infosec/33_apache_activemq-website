This directory houses an index.md file for redirecting various old report pages on the website (removed due to no longer being referenced on the site) to an index page noting the locations of the published approved minutes on Whimsy and the ASF site.

There is also a raw file DRAFT-ActiveMQ-board-report.txt, to be used for preparing the next quarterly ASF board report before submission.
