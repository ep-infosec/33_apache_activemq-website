# Release Notes - ActiveMQ Artemis - Version 2.26.0

#### Upgrading from older versions
1. We removed the *-all clients from ./lib/client in the assembly as part of [ARTEMIS-4006](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-4006). If you use these libraries they can be found at Maven Central, please refer to the [client class path documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/client-classpath) for more information.
2. We removed ActiveMQ-Artemis rest as part of 2.26.0. If you still require activemq rest you can still have access to its latest version at [Maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.activemq.rest/artemis-rest/2.25.0). You can still follow the steps on Rest from any [previous documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/2.24.0/rest.html), however you should stop using the module as it will not be maintained any more.
3. We removed web content from distribution and redirected to the console web requests with the root target as part of  [ARTEMIS-3980](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-3980). If you used to customize the index page or to add custom content in the web folder please refer to the [web-server documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/web-server) for more information on disabling the redirect and enabling the web content.
