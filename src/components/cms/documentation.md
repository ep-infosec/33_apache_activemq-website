### Overview

CMS (stands for C++ Messaging Service) is a JMS-like API for C++ for interfacing with Message Brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ. CMS helps to make your C++ client code much neater and easier to follow. To get a better feel for CMS try the API Reference. ActiveMQ-CPP is a client only library, a message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ is still needed for your clients to communicate.

Our implementation of CMS is called ActiveMQ-CPP, which has an architecture that allows for pluggable transports and wire formats. Currently we support the OpenWire and Stomp protocols, both over TCP and SSL, we also now support a Failover Transport for more reliable client operation. In addition to CMS, ActiveMQ-CPP also provides a robust set of classes that support platform independent constructs such as threading, I/O, sockets, etc. You may find many of these utilities very useful, such as a Java like Thread class or the "synchronized" macro that let's you use a Java-like synchronization on any object that implements the activemq::concurrent::Synchronizable interface. ActiveMQ-CPP is released under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
